First real assignment that uses the rottentomatoes api.

time spent : 12 hours

tasks completed:

* User can view a list of movies from Rotten Tomatoes. Poster images must be loading asynchronously.
* User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
* User sees loading state while waiting for movies API. 
* User sees error message when there's a networking error. You may not use UIAlertView or a 3rd party library to display the error. See this screenshot for what the error message should look like: network error screenshot.
* User can pull to refresh the movie list. 
* optional: For the large poster, load the low-res image first, switch to high-res when complete

Notes: 
  I tried a little bit with layout and it took me some time to get the details view working. I tried using taps for dvd and movies, but did not have time to figure out how to catch the click events.
